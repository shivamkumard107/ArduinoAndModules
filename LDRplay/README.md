I was fun playing the T rex dinosaur game with the light dependant resistor and servo motor

- T rex Game: https://elgoog.im/t-rex/

- Circuit Diagram: https://maker.pro/arduino/tutorial/how-to-use-an-ldr-sensor-with-arduino

Issues:
- Two LDRs or more are required as there is an acceleration in the dinosaur. 
  Due to the constant increase in speed the the LDR detect the trees late and servo is not prepared for the tree just after the current tree is jumped
